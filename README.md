# IoT-Watering-System
Inspiration:
Watering plants have always been a part of my mum’s daily life since I could remember. However, she had always been complaining they were too difficult to maintain as they always ended up either being overwatered or underwatered. Last year in my Year 6 Science class, I learnt that plants are very individual and different plants require different level of moisture in growth, so I decided to build this ‘smart’ IoT watering system. It has been working so well in helping my mum to maintain her plants both indoor and outdoor.
