# IoT-Watering-System
Inspiration:
Plants are always a part of my daily life. For example, they've reduced indoor air pollution, enhance our mood, better decoration, etc. However in the past almost every plant I've been maintaining, either dies from being overwatered, or a shortage of water. So today I decided to build a smart IoT watering system.

How it works:
This device briefly includes a solenoid valve - (to control the flow of water), a capacitive soil sensor to read the moisture of the soil, bme280 to read surrounding environment, which sends data to Blynk.
